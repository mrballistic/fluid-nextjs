# Tech Context: Fluid NextJS

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: React-based framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **WebGL**: JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within web browsers.
- **TypeScript**: Primary language for frontend components, providing type safety and improved developer experience.
- **JavaScript**: Used for WebGL components and simulation logic.

## Development Setup
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Build Tool**: Next.js built-in build system
- **Linting and Formatting**: ESLint and Prettier configured for consistent code quality and style.
- **Version Control**: Git, hosted on GitHub.

## Technical Constraints
- Performance optimization is critical due to the computational intensity of fluid simulations.
- Cross-browser compatibility must be maintained, particularly for WebGL features.
- Responsiveness and smooth user interactions are essential for user experience.

## Dependencies
- **Next.js**: Core framework for frontend development.
- **React**: UI library used by Next.js.
- **ESLint**: Code linting tool for maintaining code quality.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter for consistent styling.
- Additional dependencies may be evaluated and added as needed for simulation enhancements and optimizations.

## Environment
- Development primarily on macOS.
- Testing across major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
