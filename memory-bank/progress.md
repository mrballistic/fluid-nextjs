# Progress: Fluid NextJS

## Current Status
The Fluid NextJS project is currently in active development. Initial foundational components have been established, and the project is progressing steadily through the early stages of implementation.

## What Works
- Basic Next.js project setup and structure.
- WebGL context initialization and management.
- Shader compilation, linking, and basic management.
- Initial fluid simulation logic and rendering pipeline.

## What's Left to Build
- Advanced fluid dynamics algorithms for realistic simulation.
- Enhanced visual effects and shader improvements.
- Interactive user controls and UI integration.
- Performance optimizations for improved responsiveness.
- Cross-browser compatibility testing and adjustments.
- Comprehensive documentation, examples, and integration guides.

## Known Issues
- Current fluid simulation lacks realism and detailed visual fidelity.
- Performance optimization required for smoother rendering and interaction.
- Limited user interaction capabilities at this stage.

## Immediate Priorities
- Improve fluid simulation realism and visual quality.
- Optimize rendering performance and responsiveness.
- Develop interactive controls and user interface enhancements.
