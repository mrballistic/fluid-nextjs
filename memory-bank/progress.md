# Progress Report: Fluid NextJS

## What Works
- Next.js project structure and basic setup
- WebGL context initialization and management
- Shader compilation and program linking
- Framebuffer creation and management
- Basic fluid simulation algorithms
- Event handling infrastructure (events are being captured)
- Rendering pipeline for the dye texture

## What's In Progress
- Debugging the splat rendering issue (splats aren't showing up)
- Optimizing the fluid simulation performance
- Improving the visual quality of the simulation

## Current Status
- The application initializes correctly
- WebGL context and shaders are set up properly
- Event handlers are receiving events
- The dye texture is being rendered
- However, splats are not appearing on the screen when interacting with the canvas

## Known Issues
- **Critical**: Splats aren't showing up despite events being captured and processed
- The event handling might not be correctly passing coordinates to the splat function
- There might be issues with the display shader or blending settings
- The splat color and radius settings might need adjustment

## Technical Debt
- Need more comprehensive logging throughout the rendering pipeline
- Should add more error handling for WebGL operations
- Consider adding unit tests for the fluid simulation components
- Might need to refactor the event handling code for better reliability
