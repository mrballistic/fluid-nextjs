# Active Context: Fluid NextJS

## Current Work Focus
- Developing and refining core WebGL fluid simulation components.
- Integrating fluid simulation into Next.js frontend components.
- Optimizing performance and responsiveness of the simulation.

## Recent Changes
- Initial setup of Next.js project structure and WebGL integration.
- Implementation of foundational WebGL context management and shader management.
- Creation of initial fluid simulation logic and basic rendering pipeline.

## Next Steps
- Enhance fluid simulation realism and visual fidelity.
- Improve performance through optimization of WebGL shaders and framebuffers.
- Develop interactive controls and user interface elements for the simulation.
- Conduct cross-browser testing and ensure responsive design.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Evaluating shader optimization techniques for improved performance.
- Deciding on the best approach for user interaction and simulation controls.
- Considering potential third-party libraries or tools to enhance development efficiency.
