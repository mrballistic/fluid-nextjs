# Active Context: Fluid NextJS 🌊

## Current Work Focus
- 🏗️ Refactoring the fluid simulation code into smaller, more manageable components.
- 🔄 Fixing Y-axis inversion issues in the fluid simulation's mouse interaction.
- 🖱️ Debugging and fixing issues with the fluid simulation's mouse interaction.
- 🎯 Ensuring splats appear at the correct mouse position when clicked.
- ⚡ Optimizing event handling for better user experience.
- 🛠️ Resolving turbopack compatibility issues with Next.js 15.3.0.
- 📝 Enhancing documentation with emojis for better readability and visual appeal.

## Recent Changes
- 🏗️ Refactored FluidSimulation.js into smaller, more modular components:
  - 📁 Created `config/fluidConfig.js` for configuration settings
  - 📁 Created `webgl/BlitManager.js` for WebGL rendering utilities
  - 📁 Created `webgl/FluidKernels.js` for simulation step functions
  - 📁 Created `webgl/RenderManager.js` for the rendering pipeline
  - 📁 Created `webgl/SplatManager.js` for splat creation functionality
  - 📁 Simplified `FluidSimulation.js` to be an orchestration class
- 🔄 Fixed Y-axis inversion in the fluid simulation by aggressively inverting the Y velocity in the splat function.
- 🚫 Removed automatic splats to make the fluid behavior clearer and more responsive to user interaction.
- 🖱️ Modified the handlePointerMove function to explicitly invert the Y velocity for correct fluid movement.
- 📋 Added detailed logging of velocity values to help debug the Y-axis inversion issue.
- ✅ Added direct event handlers to the canvas element for better event capture.
- 🛑 Added stopPropagation() to prevent event bubbling and ensure events are handled at the correct level.
- 📊 Modified the main page.tsx to set a higher z-index for the fluid container.
- 📋 Added detailed logging to trace event propagation and coordinate transformations.
- 🚫 Removed turbopack flag from npm dev script to resolve 500 errors.
- 📚 Updated README.md with emojis to improve documentation readability.

## Current Bug Investigation
- 🔄 Investigating and fixing Y-axis inversion issues in the fluid simulation.
- 🔍 Identified that the Y-axis inversion was happening in multiple places, causing confusion.
- ✅ Fixed the issue by aggressively inverting the Y velocity in the splat function.
- ✅ Fixed the issue where mouse-triggered splats weren't showing up at the correct position.
- 🔍 Identified that the problem was related to event handling and propagation.
- ✅ Confirmed that the WebGL coordinate transformation is working correctly.
- ✅ Verified that the splat rendering pipeline is functioning properly.
- ✅ Resolved turbopack compatibility issues by switching to the standard Next.js development server.
- 🏗️ Improved code organization through modular architecture.

## Next Steps
- 🧹 Clean up debugging logs once the implementation is stable.
- ⚡ Optimize performance by reducing unnecessary calculations.
- 🎨 Consider adding more interactive features like color pickers or effect controls.
- 📱 Improve mobile touch support for better cross-device experience.
- 🔍 Add visual indicators to show where clicks are being registered.
- 👀 Monitor for any additional compatibility issues with Next.js 15.3.0.
- 📝 Continue using emojis in documentation for better readability.
- 🧪 Add unit tests for the refactored components.
- 📚 Further improve documentation with detailed comments.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- 🏗️ Using a modular architecture to improve code organization and maintainability.
- 🖱️ Using direct event handlers on the canvas element for precise interaction.
- 🛑 Using stopPropagation() to prevent event bubbling and ensure events are handled at the correct level.
- 🔄 Using a combination of React event handlers and native DOM event listeners for comprehensive event coverage.
- ⚖️ Balancing splat size and visibility against performance considerations.
- 📋 Maintaining detailed logging during development for easier debugging.
- 🚀 Using the standard Next.js development server instead of turbopack for better stability.
- 📚 Using emojis in documentation to improve readability and visual appeal.
